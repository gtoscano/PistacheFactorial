# PistacheFactorial
This project leverages C++ and the RESTful-compatible Pistache framework to compute a simple factorial of a number. It provides client code examples in C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Octave, Python, R, and Rust, creating an all-encompassing solution for multi-language development and web accessibility.
